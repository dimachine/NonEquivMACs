# NonEquivMACs
This is a supporing file for OEIS on computation of inequivalent maximal antichains and related sequences

## Outline 

### 0. The basic code with the class for managing generation of formal concepts via NextClosure algorithm
### 1. Generation of inequivalent maximal antichains for n in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} (https://oeis.org/draft/A348260)
### 2. Extraction of maximal antichains from order ideals
### 3. Generating non-singleton maximal antichains for A326360 with n in {5,6,7} (https://oeis.org/draft/A326360)
### 4. Generation of dictionaries with all inequaivalent maximal antichains along with their orbits cardinalities for n in {1,2,3,4,5,6}
